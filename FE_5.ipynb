    "Ordinal Encoding: Ordinal Encoding is used when the categorical variables have an inherent order or rank. It assigns numerical values to categories based on their order. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"Education Level\" with categories \"High School\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Master's\", and \"PhD\", we can assign numerical values like 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: Label Encoding is used when the categorical variables do not have any inherent order. It simply assigns a unique numerical value to each category. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"Color\" with categories \"Red\", \"Green\", and \"Blue\", we can assign numerical values like 1, 2, and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset with a categorical variable \"Rating\" representing the rating of a product, with categories \"Poor\", \"Average\", \"Good\", and \"Excellent\". Since the ratings have an inherent order, we would use Ordinal Encoding to convert them into numerical values like 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, if we have another categorical variable \"Type\" representing the type of product, with categories \"Electronics\", \"Clothing\", and \"Books\", where there is no inherent order, we would use Label Encoding to convert them into numerical values like 1, 2, and 3."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used for ordinal encoding where the numerical values are assigned based on the target variable. It's particularly useful when there is a relationship between the categories and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: For each category in the categorical variable, it calculates the mean of the target variable (e.g., the mean of the target variable for each category). Then, it assigns numerical values to the categories based on these means in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a machine learning project predicting customer satisfaction, we have a categorical variable \"Feedback\" with categories \"Poor\", \"Average\", \"Good\", and \"Excellent\". We can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to assign numerical values based on the average satisfaction score for each category. For instance, if the average satisfaction score for \"Poor\" feedback is lowest and the highest for \"Excellent\" feedback, we can assign numerical values like 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively"

    "Covariance is a measure that indicates the extent to which two random variables change together. It shows the direction of the linear relationship between two variables (whether they move in the same direction or opposite directions) and the magnitude of this relationship\n",

If the covariance is positive, it indicates that the variables move together (positive correlation), while a negative covariance suggests they move in opposite directions (negative correlation).\n"
